          <p className="pt-2">I met him in the Rain!</p>
          <p>Lol, so for real... our love story started in the rain.</p>
          <p className="pt-4 ">
            I resumed at the Obafemi Awolowo University Ile Ife in May 2016.
            Shortly after resumption, I recall it was raining that evening and I
            was hungry but I had no cash on me so I decided to take a walk from
            my hostel to ATM (No ATM anywhere around the hostel at that time).
            Although the rain was heavy I did not mind since I had an umbrella
            and I also enjoyed walking around the campus (as per “omo get
            inside” that I am but who is now a University undergraduate).
          </p>
          <p className="pt-4">
            After I had walked from my hostel (Mozambique hall) to Moremi hall,
            I realized that the tip of my trousers was wet so I waited at Moremi
            hall to roll up my trouser and continue my walk to the ATM point
            situated at the popular ‘White House’. As I was walking towards
            OAU’s White House, just after approaching Moremi’s gate, someone
            tapped on my left shoulder and asked if he could share my umbrella.
            Well, here’s a tall, dark and handsome young man, so why not
            &#128513;. I got to the ATM, he requested my contact, I obliged and
            we both went our different ways.
          </p>
          <p className="pt-4">
            A week after I matriculated, my phone was stolen so I lost his
            contact and we didn’t know much about each other, he also didn't
            care to know my hostel/room number, but he knew I read every night
            at the 'oven' lecture theatre at the White House (as a part one
            student aspiring to have my ”dream 5.0 CGPA.. &#128516;). Unknown to
            me, this man had been coming to White House to look for me.
          </p>
          <p className="py-4">
            Fortunately, we bumped into each other again a few weeks later at
            another location where we had both come to read. So we exchanged
            contact again, became friends and spoke/chatted every other day.
            Fast forward to January 30th 2016, after so many prayers and
            fasting, I agreed to start this thing called LOVE with him.

            The journey of 5 years plus has been an amazing one with my UMBRELLA
            boy &#128513;

          <p className="pt-4">
            P.S: I have the world's kindest, sweetest, calmest and most amazing
            man all to myself &#128525;

          <p className="pt-2">
            I started my postgraduate program at the Obafemi Awolowo University,
            Ile-Ife, Osun State in 2014 and the duration of my Master’s Degree
            should normally take four (4) semesters but due to the nature of my
            research, I had to apply for two (2) semesters extension to enable
            me complete my project. That was when I met her, it was during my
            extension. Lol, maybe I would not have met her if I had finished in
            due time.. just maybe!
          </p>

          <p className="pt-4 ">
            Before the day that I saw her, I had been praying and trusting God
            for a partner and the answer came on a beautiful rainy sunday
            evening. I was on my way to the laboratory and suddenly the rain
            started, it was so heavy that I had to look for a place to stay. I
            waited under the shed at the entrance to Moremi Hall.
          </p>
          <p className="pt-4">
            A few minutes later, I sighted this beautiful lady walking towards
            my direction and she held an umbrella. From her physique, I could
            tell that she was an undergraduate student. As the shy person that I
            am, I kept on asking myself if I should ask for help or not, coupled
            with the tradition in OAU where postgraduate students don’t like to
            interact with undergraduates to avoid disrespect. But that day, it
            was important that I quickly get to the laboratory and record the
            results of the time-based experiment I was conducting. I had no
            choice, but at this point, she had already walked past me, I ran
            after her and asked if she was going my way and if she could share
            her umbrella with me, she responded softly with a yes and we walked
            down until she got to where she was going. As a gentleman, I asked
            for her name, her course of study and her current level, that was
            when I confirmed she was a ‘fresh student’ who had just resumed
            school. We exchanged numbers and I went my way.
          </p>
          <p className="pt-4">
            In OAU, there’s this popular “catch them young” slang people say,
            it’s used when an old student is trying to prey on the naivety of a
            new student. So after I knew that she was a ‘fresher’, I wasn’t
            hoping to meet her again. A master’s student shouldn’t be ‘moving
            to’ with a fresh (100L) student, no ‘nau’ &#128518;.. It felt
            awkward (at that time).
          </p>
          <p className="py-4">
            Days went by, I didn’t reach out but every day as I walked around
            the campus, I always wished that our paths crossed again. We had met
            just once (the day it rained) and I could barely remember her face
            but I remembered her hair colour, so I always looked out for ladies
            with that kind of hairdo.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fortunately for me, I saw her a few weeks later where I had also
            gone to read and we spoke a bit. Occasionally, I will chat her up to
            check up on her and in the process, I got to know she was a member
            of a ministry that sensitized teenagers and youths on no sex before
            marriage and sexual purity, it then occurred to me that this wasn’t
            a naive fresh student, she was different. All of these and many
            other attributes fascinated me but we remained casual friends.
          </p>
          <p className="pt-4">
            Then she invited me for her birthday photo session on the 18th of
            August 2016 where I met a few of her friends and we took turns to
            snap with the celebrant. That was when I met Queen Tama who will
            later become helpful in our budding love story.
          </p>
          <p className="py-4">
            Some days after, her phone number became unreachable and I searched
            everywhere for her. I was disturbed until I got the idea to search
            her name on Facebook and luckily for me, I found a post published by
            ‘Queen Tama’ on her timeline. I remember seeing Tama at the birthday
            shoot so I messaged her and she told me that her phone had been
            stolen. With the help of Queen Tama, I was able to reconnect with
            Oluwabukunmi and from that moment, I knew that I had developed a
            soft spot for this lady and our friendship wax stronger.
          </p>
          <p>
            Along the line, I knew within my spirit that she was the one God had
            prepared for me but I continued in prayers and waited to hear from
            God. Seven months after the first day we met, I made my intentions
            known and she requested I give her time to pray about it. On the
            30th of January 2017, she said yes to courtship and we both agreed
            to give it time so she could give attention to her studies!
          </p>
          <p className="py-4">
            I completed my postgraduate degree a few weeks later and left OAU.
            Thanks to her friends; Tayelolu, Blessing and Titi who became my
            third eye.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here we are, about to walk down the aisle after 5 years, 5 months, 2
            weeks and 2 days. This is a dream come true and I’m happy to have
            this beauty in my corner.
          </p>
          <p className="pt-2">
            I promise to love and cherish you forever, Oluwabukunmi &#128525;
